# Resolve AI (v0.5.0-beta)

**AI motion graphics inside DaVinci Resolve**
*by Oleg Kupshukov*

Resolve AI is a Workflow Integration Plugin that brings AI-powered motion graphics generation directly into DaVinci Resolve Studio. Describe what you want in plain text, and either Claude Code or OpenAI Codex generates the animation code, renders it to ProRes 4444 with alpha transparency, and imports it to your timeline.

## Requirements

- **DaVinci Resolve Studio 21+** (not the free version — Workflow Integration Plugins require Studio)
- **Node.js 18+** — required by the AI CLI integrations
- **Claude Code CLI** with an active Pro or Max subscription, or **OpenAI Codex CLI** with a supported OpenAI/ChatGPT account
- **ffmpeg** in PATH
- **Windows** or **macOS**

Check your Node.js version:

```
node --version    # must be v18 or newer
```

On macOS, if it's older than 18, upgrade with `brew install node` (latest) or `fnm install 22`.

## Installation

### Windows
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Double-click `install.bat`
3. Restart DaVinci Resolve

### macOS
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Double-click `install.command`
3. Restart DaVinci Resolve

The installer checks for DaVinci Resolve and Node.js, installs the renderer's dependencies (Playwright + Chromium), lets you choose Codex CLI or Claude Code if no supported AI CLI is found, and copies the plugin into Resolve. After installing, open the plugin from **Workspace > Workflow Integration > Resolve AI**.

Install and log in to at least one AI CLI:

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude login
```

```
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login
```

The plugin uses each CLI's local auth. It does not store OpenAI or Anthropic API keys.
Codex auth is handled only by the Codex CLI (`codex login` / `codex login status`); Resolve AI never asks for or stores an OpenAI API key.

## Usage

### One-minute quickstart

1. Open **Workspace > Workflow Integration > Resolve AI**
2. Pick Codex or Claude in Settings
3. Click a Prompt Gallery item or type a prompt
4. Preview the generated motion graphic
5. Click **Render .mov** to import a ProRes 4444 overlay at the playhead
6. Use **Regenerate**, **Fix with AI**, **Save as Template**, or render history to iterate

### Prompt → Render Examples

| Prompt | Result |
| --- | --- |
| “Create a bold creator title card for a tech review channel.” | Full-frame title card with animated typography |
| “Create a transparent lower third for a podcast guest.” | Alpha lower third imported onto the timeline |
| “Import this SRT and make kinetic captions.” | Timed transparent caption overlay |
| “Use the selected logo as the central mark.” | Asset-aware logo reveal |

## How it works

Generates one-off HTML animations rendered frame-by-frame to ProRes 4444 .mov with alpha transparency via Playwright + ffmpeg. Full creative freedom: CSS animations, SVG, Canvas, filters, blur, backdrop-filter. The rendered .mov is automatically imported to your current timeline on an empty track at the playhead position.
Each render can also write local sidecar metadata beside the .mov so the history browser can search, restore prompts, and re-render previous work.

**Use it for:** title cards, text reveals, glitch effects, lower thirds, transitions — any specific animation for the project at hand.

## Growth Features

- **Prompt Gallery**: built-in creator, podcast, gaming, product, documentary, business, social, event, sports, and music prompts.
- **Template Packs**: local JSON packs that contributors can submit and users can import.
- **Captions**: local SRT/VTT import with clean, kinetic, karaoke, social, and podcast styles.
- **Asset-aware generation**: attach logos, products, textures, icons, and reference images with notes.
- **Fix with AI**: send render failures back to the active provider for repair.
- **Showcase builder**: export a static local showcase page from saved templates/prompts.

## Settings

Open the sidebar (gear icon) to configure:

- **Provider**: Auto, Claude Code, or Codex CLI
- **Model**: Claude Sonnet/Opus or Codex default/supported GPT model
- **FPS**: 24, 25, 30, or 60
- **Resolution**: 1920×1080, 3840×2160, 1080×1920, 1080×1350, or 1080×1080
- **Provider Health**: installed/login/version status for Claude and Codex, plus a collapsible raw log drawer for troubleshooting
- **Brand Kit**: local colors, fonts, logo path, tone, and common phrases injected into new generations
- **Asset Library**: add local PNG/JPG/WebP/SVG/GIF assets, attach selected assets to new prompts, and provide notes so the AI uses them correctly
- **Templates**: save generated overlays locally and reuse them later
- **Assets**: searchable render history with thumbnails, rename, reveal, delete, sync, and re-render

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [community-templates](community-templates/README.md). Neutral creator-focused template packs are especially useful.

Suggested GitHub topics: `davinci-resolve`, `motion-graphics`, `ai-video`, `codex`, `claude`, `electron`, `video-generation`.

## Bundled Fonts

The plugin ships with a curated set of fonts so generated animations look consistent across machines without extra installs:

- **Bricolage Grotesque**
- **Fraunces**
- **JetBrains Mono**

## Known Limitations

- Complex prompts may be slow on smaller models — switch to a stronger provider/model for detailed animations
- The plugin spawns the selected AI CLI as a subprocess — first response may take a few seconds to warm up
- This is a beta — expect rough edges; please report issues on GitHub or Discord

Tested on Windows and macOS (Apple Silicon).
